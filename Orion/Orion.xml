        <member name="T:Orion.Framework.InstancedServiceAttribute">
            <summary>
            An attribute that can be applied to a class to indicate that it is an instanced service, not a static service.

        <member name="T:Orion.Framework.IService">
            <summary>
            Represents a service.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Services are modules providing a specific type of functionality to consumers. By default, these services are
            statically loaded once Orion is loaded, and disposed once Orion is disposed. However, services can be annotated
            with <see cref="T:Orion.Framework.InstancedServiceAttribute"/>, in which case they will be injected per-instance and disposed
            once the parent object is garbage collected.
